# Switching from OpenAI to Nillion AI in Agentkit

This document showcases the exceptional ease of integrating Nillion AI into Agentkit. Nillion's developer-friendly design makes the transition from other LLM providers remarkably straightforward, requiring only minimal configuration changes.

## Original OpenAI Implementation

```python
# Initialize the LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
```

## Nillion AI Implementation

```python
# Initialize the LLM with Nillion AI
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    base_url="https://nilai-a779.nillion.network/v1",
    default_headers={
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer Nillion2025",
    }
)
```

## Key Differences

1. **Model Specification**: Changed from `gpt-4` to `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`
2. **Base URL**: Added Nillion's API endpoint
3. **Headers**: Added necessary authentication and content type headers

## Benefits of Easy Integration

1. **Flexibility**: Easily switch between different LLM providers
2. **Privacy**: Leverage Nillion's privacy-preserving Gen AI computation
3. **Cost-Effective**: Alternative to OpenAI's pricing model
4. **No Architecture Changes**: Rest of the Agentkit implementation remains unchanged

## Implementation Example

The switch is demonstrated in the `initialize_agent_test()` function in our application, where we simply modify the LLM initialization while keeping all other agent functionality intact:

```python
def initialize_agent_test():
    """
    Initialize the agent with CDP Agentkit using Nillion AI.
    """
    # Initialize the LLM with Nillion
    llm = ChatOpenAI(
        model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
        base_url="https://nilai-a779.nillion.network/v1",
        default_headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Accept": "application/json",
            "Authorization": "Bearer Nillion2025",
        }
    )
    
    # Rest of the agent initialization remains the same
    # ...
```

## Benefits of Choosing Nillion

1. **Seamless Developer Experience**: Integration that just works
2. **Enterprise-Grade Privacy**: Industry-leading privacy preservation
3. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Built for enterprise workloads
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Access to cutting-edge LLM technology
5. **Future-Proof**: Regular updates and new model availability

Nillion's thoughtful API design ensures that developers can focus on building great applications while leveraging powerful AI capabilities with built-in privacy guarantees.

## Why This Implementation Matters

This plug-and-play integration demonstrates how to seamlessly incorporate Nillion's privacy-preserving AI into existing agent frameworks with just 3 lines of configuration changes, making enterprise-grade AI privacy accessible to all developers.
